    <!-- One beautiful thing about react is that it can be applied only to a portion of your website.
         React only works where your root is.
         So, react is a library, it can run independently in a portion of your web page.
         At the end of the day react is just a piece of JS written by Facebook Developers.
         It is just giving us some helper methods to use and develop our application fast.
         One more advantage of using react is you can use it in a section of your application, but not all frameworks support working in
         existing app, they altogeher require to build a new app.
