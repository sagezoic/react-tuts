Coding
- Build a Food Ordering App
    - Think of a cool name for your app
    - Build a AppLayout
    - Build a Header Component with Logo & Nav Items & Cart
    - Build a Body Component
        - Build RestaurantList Component
        - Build RestaurantCard Component
            - Use static data initially
            - Make your card dynamic(pass in props)
                - Props - passing arguments to a function - Use Destructuring & Spread operator
            - Render your cards with dynamic data of restaurants
            - Use Array.map to render all the restaurants
PS. Basically do everything that I did in the class, in the same sequence. Don't skip small things.
